# Neural-Network-Reinforcement-Learning
This project is created in c# using Unity3D Game Engine.

In the project a neural network is developed and a car uses that neural network to train itself to drive. Several techniques are used in the project such as RL, PSO and GA.

Currently the project uses Multi layered feed farward network but after RL is fully implimented the development on recurrent neural network will start.

To open or build the project please download a copy of unity and open the folder using unity3d.
